# Progress Journal

> Append-only run journal. The `manager` updates this as backlog items move through the
> pipeline, so the whole run is auditable. Newest at the bottom.

## Format

```
## <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM> — B<n>: <item title>
- <agent>: <what it did> → <outcome>
- ...
- result: <done | escalated | paused for review> — <commit hash if committed>
```

When the manager **pauses** (review checkpoint) or **escalates** (unresolved failure),
it records the reason here AND states it in chat.
